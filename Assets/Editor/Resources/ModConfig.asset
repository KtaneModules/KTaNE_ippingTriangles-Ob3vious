  description: 'Behold, another lookalike module pack to compensate for the loss of
    the Beans. This time I am *shipping* a lot of triangles with really similar names.
    Be careful not to go *tripping* over the pronunciation or it might mean trouble.
    Other than that they''re pretty easy. Enjoy!


    (also the pack might expand later)'
